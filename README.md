## Overview

This workflow powers an AI assistant that lives in Telegram. It listens for messages, responds with intelligent prompts, scrapes lead-related information using a tool module, and retains memory for smarter follow-ups.

It's ideal for small businesses, marketers, or solo founders who want to automate early-stage lead engagement.
